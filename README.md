# Kungfu-Taxi
This Project was done without using Github. The source code cannot be posted here due to NDA.

This [**video clip**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAqjmC4-qs) gives a quick view of this game. [**Download** (iOS)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kungfutaxi/id522037051?mt=8) the game and have fun!

The diagrams posted here illustrate the basic code design of this game.

1. The [use case diagram](../master/Diagrams/Use%20Case%20Diagram.pdf) gives a breakdown of the functionality. Use cases are pruned for clearity.

2. The [activity diagram](../master/Diagrams/Activity%20Diagram.pdf) illustrates the flow of the main activities within a game life cycle (level-wise).

3. The [class diagram](../master/Diagrams/Class%20Diagram.pdf) shows the design of the classes.

4. The [state diagram](../master/Diagrams/State%20Diagram.pdf) depicts the states of the game character and the transitions between them. This is borrowed from the idea of finite state machine (FSM).

5. The [flow chart](../master/Diagrams/Flow%20Chart.pdf) charts the selected procedures (four picked). 

6. The [hit area schematic diagram](../master/Diagrams/Hit%20Area%20Schematic%20Diagram.pdf) and the [hit areas of the objects](../master/Diagrams/Hit%20Areas%20of%20the%20objects.pdf) delineate the borders of hit areas for both the character (red) and other objects(green).
