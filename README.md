2. The [activity diagram](../master/docs/Activity%20Diagram.pdf) illustrates the flow of the main activities within a game life cycle (level-wise).
3. The [class diagram](../master/docs/Class%20Diagram.pdf) shows the design of the classes.
4. The [state diagram](../master/docs/State%20Diagram.pdf) depicts the states of the game character and the transitions between them. This is borrowed from the idea of finite state machine (FSM).
5. The [flow chart](../master/docs/Flow%20Chart.pdf) charts the selected procedures (four picked). 
6. The [hit area schematic diagram](../master/docs/Hit%20Area%20Schematic%20Diagram.pdf) and the [hit areas of the objects](../master/docs/Hit%20Areas%20of%20the%20objects.pdf) delineate the hit areas for both the character (red) and other objects(green).
