### Diagrams
The diagrams below illustrate the basic code design of this game. This Project was done without using Github. The source code cannot be posted here.

1. The use case diagram gives a breakdown of the functionality. Use cases are pruned for clearity.

2. The [activity diagram](../master/docs/Activity%20Diagram.pdf) illustrates the flow of the main activities within a game life cycle (level-wise).
3. The [class diagram](../master/docs/Class%20Diagram.pdf) shows the design of the classes.
4. The [state diagram](../master/docs/State%20Diagram.pdf) depicts the states of the game character and the transitions between them. This is borrowed from the idea of finite state machine (FSM).
5. The [flow chart](../master/docs/Flow%20Chart.pdf) charts the selected procedures (four picked). 
6. The [hit area schematic diagram](../master/docs/Hit%20Area%20Schematic%20Diagram.pdf) and the [hit areas of the objects](../master/docs/Hit%20Areas%20of%20the%20objects.pdf) delineate the hit areas for both the character (red) and other objects(green).
